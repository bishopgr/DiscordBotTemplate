# DiscordBotTemplate
Template for running Discord Bots using Discord.NET. Uses .NET 6. Comes with a Hello World command to get you started. Based off of the tutorial from [Discord.NET](https://discordnet.dev/)

# Usage
Create a `discord-conf.json` (or whatever you want to name the file) that looks like this:

```
{
  "DiscordSettings": {
    "Token": "<Your-Token-Here>"
  }
}
```

Afterward, you should be able to build and run. Enjoy your bot!

## Getting a token
Follow the directions at [Discord.NET's tutorial](https://discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html)
